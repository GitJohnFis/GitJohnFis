# 👋 Hi, I’m @GitJohnFis
- 👀 I’m interested in creating retro and futuristic mixed JavaScript games, CSS, and more specifically, reversing a linked tree.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to print simple 10-character strings in assembly code using the terminal in VSCode Codespaces, with a bit of disappointment that it doesn't look like FNV Nipton house's.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a JavaScript text-based RPG game with a reputation system and a revive function that lets you replay the game with zero resources but a lot of experience. I also want to include a few more easter eggs that can only be seen when nearly dying and straying from the objective of the game, as well as winning and defeating the final boss.
